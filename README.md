# Predictably Wrong

A Reddit game where you share your opinion on questions and predict what the average Redditor will think about them.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is This?

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

### Gameplay

The concept is simple: **predict what the average Redditor will think** about various questions. It's not about being "right" - it's about understanding the crowd.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Submit Questions**: Click the three dots in the top right corner of any post and select "Submit Question" to add your own questions
2. **Share Opinion & Predict**: Share your honest opinion AND predict what the average will be
3. **Wait for Results**: Let others share their opinions and make their predictions
4. **Check Your Accuracy**: Return later to see how well you predicted the crowd's opinion
