## Predictably Wrong

**It's stupidly simple:** Try to predict what the **average Redditor** will think about a controversial or not-so-controversial question.

**Can you prove your superiority?** Not by being "right," but by reading the average Redditor like an open book.

**Don't like the questions?** _Create your own!_

**How does it work?**
1. **Submit** a controversial or not-so-controversial question by clicking the three dots in the top right corner of the post and selecting **Submit Question**.
2. **Vote** on the question with your honest opinion **and** try to predict what the _average_ will think.
3. **Others** can also vote and predict what the _average_ will think.
4. ** later** to see how accurate your predictions were compared to the actual results.
